# OVBanalysis

# Highlights
·  	Omitted variable bias (OVB) is a challenging and ubiquitous problem in observational settings that can invalidate conclusions from observational studies.
·  	OVB occurs when important confounders are missing in a causal model.
·  	We hypothesize that including precision variables (those that affect the outcome, not the exposure) can improve the precision of estimates even under OVB.
·  	We conduct a simulation study testing the impact of including precision variables.
·  	Next, we investigate the impact of OVB, estimating the effect of depression on the risk of AD.
·  	We compare the impact of including confounders from computable knowledge to confounders reported in published observational studies.
